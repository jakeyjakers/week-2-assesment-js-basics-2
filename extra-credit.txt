1. Weave. they use react, ngnix, cloudfare and angular. I think it could be good ato worka there because they 
are local and use aomong a long list, html, css, react, and angular. It could be a good first job in tech.

2. My brother in laws company. I can't currnently say exactly what they are currrently doing as my brother in law 
who works for them could get in trouble. They use java, rust, and react amonsgst others. I'd like to work there because 
they have a decent apprenticeship program and I'd be using React to help build their web app and program.

3. JB hunt. My neighbor works for this company and i think it could be good to work for them as a front end engineer 
to further polish my front end skills. And it's work from home. They use several javaScript frameworks and libraries.
